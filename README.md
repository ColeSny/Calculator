This was the first iteration of my calculator program.
My main flaws with this program are:
- I checked strings with (==/!=) instead of .equals().
- I had logic errors in the main while loop, just like the first error i should have used .equals().
- The handling of the user inputs were inconsistant.
- I forgot to add the return type for the Menu() method.
- Runtime errors from user input.
- There is redundant code.

Overall there are many refinements that had to be made which are mostly in V2.
