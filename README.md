This is the second iteration of my Java calculator program.
This version uses inheritance and polymorphism. This is an upgrade from the first version. 
Issues:
- Still uses incorrect String comparison.
- Inefficient use of Boolean condition.
- Redundant code.
- Incorrect handling of values.
- Missing input validation.
