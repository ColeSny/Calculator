This is the most up-to-date version of my calculator program (V3).
I created this version by implementing design patterns such as strategy and command. 
It also implements a more advanced version of polymorphism and inheritance. This is shown in the operator interface as well as the Calculator class. 
This version has a more concise main method, which is easy to read.
